# SeeFood Android

Currently, the client corresponds to DogLens

TODO:

1. Change from DogLens to SeeFood.
2. New animations
3. Add restaurant support
4. Add recipe support (Maybe no, because we aren't recognizing food, but only the cuisine)
5. Add average nutrition value support


NOTE: Keep the city id dynamic, it should gather the data from gps and get the city id from Zomato. Store all the ids in our DB to reduce API calls to Zomato.
